## hash table

1. load factor
   1. key count / capacity of hash table
2. collision handling
   1. separate chaining (closed addressing)
      1. conflict key is kept in the same location as a linked list
      2. waste of space (linked list & not used key)
      3. less sensitive to hash function and load factor
   2. open addressing
      1. probe for a open address to put in the key
      2. linear probe / quadratic probe / double hashing
      3. table can become full
   3. double hashing
      1. use another function hash again and help generate new address
   4. coalesced hashing
      1. combine open addressing and chaining
      2. all keys are stored in table, but each node will hold a pointer to next conflicted key
   5. overflow area
      1. conflict keys are kept in overflow area
   6. Cuckoo
      1. using two or more hash functions, check if one of the two possible positions is open
      2. when conflicting, push old key to its possibly open position.
         More positions should be available due to multiple hash function.

### implementation in different language

* c++: unordered_map
  * By default, use `std::hash`, which can be specialized for custom class.
  * Otherwise, we can provide a functor template to generate hash
  * no specialization for `const char *`
  * specialization exist for all pointers `std::hash<T*>`
* python: dict
  * an object is hashable if `__hash__(), __eq__()`
  * by default, `__hash__()` is derived from `id()`
  * `id()` is guaranteed to unique during its lifetime
    * in cpython, it is the address of object

## hash function

### for hash table

1. hash = key % table_size
2. hash = key % m -> m being a prime number can help reduce collision
3. hash = rand(key) % m
4. hash = (a * key + b) % m

### cryptographic hash

Hash based message authentication code (HMAC): RFC 2104

\\[
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{HMAC}(K, m) &= \operatorname{H}\Bigl(\bigl(K' \oplus opad\bigr) \parallel 
  \operatorname{H} \bigl(\left(K' \oplus ipad\right) \parallel m\bigr)\Bigr) \\
K' &= \begin{cases}
  \operatorname{H}\left(K\right) & K\text{ is larger than block size} \\
  K                              & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
\\]

Normal hash functions starts from a known state, 
and results with its internal state.
So, it is easy to modify the message and have the same hash.

SHA 1, 2, 3

## Bloom filter

- filter out values that are definitely not in the set
- use a total of m bits + k hash function
- when a value enters the set, it occupies k bits
- when query for a value, if any result bit is zero, the value is not in the set
  - more hash function means more false positive
  - more hash function also means more chance to filter out result
- optimal k = `m / n ln(2)`
  - where n is total number of element
