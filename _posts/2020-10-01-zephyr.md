## install zephyr

* `west init`: install zephyr in current folder with default yml
  * we can init with a manifest file
    * the manifest file will have its own repo
    * other repos can be included as module
  * [forest topology](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/west/repo-tool.html#t3-forest-topology)
* use modules to define out of tree board, dts, drivers, etc
  * repo should contain `zephyr/module.yml`
  * [Reference](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/modules.html)
  * [kconfig extensions](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/kconfig/extensions.html)

## Kconfig

* [Reference](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/kconfig/setting.html#the-initial-configuration)
* build/zephyr/.config is generated based on the following sources
  * board config `<BOARD>_defconfig`
  * CMAKE cache `CONFIG_`
  * application conf file: `prj.conf` and etc
* Kconfig item without label is invisible in menuconfig

### board porting

* [Reference](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/porting/board_porting.html#write-kconfig-files)
* `Kconfig.board`
  * define options in menuconfig
* board specific kconfig defaults
  * `Kconfig.defconfig`: invisible Kconfig symbols
  * `<BOARD>_defconfig`: visible Kconfig symbols

## device tree

* [Specification](https://www.devicetree.org/)
* [Reference](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/guides/dts/intro.html)
* each node is named like `[label:] node-name[@unit-address]`
* `node-name` should describe teh general class of device
  * tree struct starts from root node `/`
* `unit-address`: differentiate node based on bus address, but for naming purpose only
  * actual bus address is determined by node's `reg` property
    * `reg` is constructed by concat address + size (i.e. offset)
  * `#address-cells`, `#size-cells`: specified by parent bus controller
    * `#address-cells`: number of `<u32>` cells in `reg` for address
    * `#size-cells`: number of `<u32>` cells in `reg` for size
* `label`: unique shorthand for identifying node
  * a node can have zero, one, or multiple node labels
  * translate into `phandle` which compiling
* node property
  * `compatible`: specify driver to be used
  * node name is contained in property
    * `label`: `device_get_binding()`
    * `name`: ?
* `/aliases`: gloabl section for node name to label mapping
* `/chosen`: describe non-hardware parameters. ex. `bootargs`

* device tree puts no contraint over its content
  * `dts/bindings`: enforce tree structure & parsing requirement.
  * `dt_schema`: used in linux kernel with slight different definition

### device access

* get node id
  * cannot assign to variable
  * `DT_PATH()`: from tree path
  * `DT_NODELABEL()`: from node_label
  * `DT_ALIAS()`: from `/aliases`
  * `DT_INST()`: get one compatible device via its instance number
    * order of instance is not guaranteed
* get node label
  * `DT_LABEL`
* get device binding
  * notice that device loading depend on priority

### device driver

* `struct device *`
  * config: build time configuration
  * data: driver data
  * api: sub system api

### macro

* device tree content will be convert to macro with the help of bindings
  * if a matching driver is not found
    * the compilation still pass
    * the device is not used
    * the dt entry can get accessed
* driver macro defined as `#define DT_DRV_COMPAT ...`
  * if dt macro is not defined, ie device does not exist
    * compilation fail becasue driver cannot be registered.

### interrupt

* gpio:
  * `gpio_pin_configure()`
    * init gpio struct for read
  * `gpio_init_callback()` init cb struct
    * with callback func and pin mask
  * `gpio_add_callback()` add gpio to callback
  * `gpio_pin_interrupt_configure()`
    * enable interrupt for gpio struct
* callback func:
  * called with gpio struct + cb struct + pin mask
  * should trigger worker thread
* global thread `k_work`
  * trigger by `k_work_submit`
  * `k_work.handler` stores the actual work
* local thread
  * trigger by semphemore `k_sem_give`
