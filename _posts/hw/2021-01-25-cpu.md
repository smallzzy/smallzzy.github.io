## general design problem

- pipeline hazard
  - control hazard: unpredictable branching
  - dependency hazard:
    - forwarding
  - structural hazard: station being occupied
- cache:
  - size
    - cache line size
    - total size
  - access pattern / hit rate
  - associativity
  - replacement policy
    - LRU, NLRU, Random

## x86 common instruction

- push: decrement stack pointer and place src on stack
  - pop
- call: store ip
  - relative: displacement relative to next instruction
- ret:
  - go to ip on stack
- lea: store effective address to reg
- enter / leave: function call meta func
  - push ebp; mov ebp,esp
  - mov esp, ebp; pop ebp

## x86 instrcution format

- instruction consists of
  - Prefix
  - Opcode
  - MOD-REG-R/M
  - SIB
  - disp
  - immediate
- cpu mode
  - Real mode
  - Protect mode / Long compatibility mode
  - Long mode
- register
  - a c d b sp bp si di
    - bp: base pointerï¼Œ stack bottom
    - sp: stack pointer, stack top
  - ip: instruction pointer
    - point to next instruction
  - segement pointer?
  - 32 bit: e\*
  - 64 bit: r\*
    - 8 x general purpose reg

### addressing

- MOD-REG-R/M: determine memory address
  - reg can used as register operand or opcode extension
  - mod 11: rm only
  - mod 00, 01, 10: 0, 1, 4 byte disp
    - rm 100: + SIB
    - mod 00, rm 101: disp32
    - other: + rm
- Scale-Index-Base (SIB):
  - scale: 1 2 4 8
  - index and base refer to registers
  - = base + index \* scale
    - index 100: index = 0
    - mod 00, base 101: base = disp32

## x86 mode

1. `real mode`: 8086
   1. 20 bit address line (1 MB)
      1. every logical address points to a physical address
      2. 16 bit segment & offset register
      3. addr = segment \* 16 + offset
   2. no access control
2. `protected mode`: 80286
   1. 32 bit virtual and physical address
      1. segmentation (`virtual 8086 mode`)
         1. 16 bit segment register is now a index to descriptor table
      2. paging
   2. 386 enables easy switch back to real mode
3. `long mode`
   1. up to 64 bit virtual, 52 bit physical address
      1. cannot run real mode nor virtual 8086 mode
      2. run protected mode as compatibility mode

### memory mess

- 0 - 640KB (0xa_0000) : `Conventional Memory`
  - Map to actual RAM on board
  - 0 - 64 KB : `Lower memory area` / `low memory area`
- 640KB - 1024 KB (0x10_0000) : `Upper memory area`
  - Map to various devices. But contains memory holes as well
  - larger than 640 KB `Expanded Memory`
- 1024KB - ~ 1088 KB (0x10_fff0) : `High memory area`
  - A20 Warp around
- larger than 1024KB `Extended memory area`

## abi design

- C language data type model
  - ILP32: int, long, pointer = 32 bit
  - LP64: long, pointer = 64 bit
- x32 abi:
  - reduce cache usage
  - limited memory range

## misc

- [instruction simulation](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html)
- model specific register
  - `rdmsr`
- intel c2000 stepping
  - check chip stepping `setpci -s 00:00.0 8.w`

## assembler

armasm
gas
has different syntax

- assembler seems to focus on binary generation
- section & func
- export
- how the section is organized is determined by linker

## ordering

- compiler reorder
  - read / write barrier: specify operation order
  - volative: non-trivial side effect being optimized out
- cpu reorder
  - memory barrier: force cache write back

### out of order

- issue width
- reservation station
  - different station can have different capability
- re-ordering buffer (ROB)
- register file vs specialized register
  - register renaming
