## general design problem

* pipeline hazard
  * control hazard: unpredictable branching
  * dependency hazard: 
    * forwarding
  * structural hazard: station being occupied
* cache:
  * size
    * cache line size
    * total size
  * access pattern / hit rate
  * associativity
  * replacement policy
    * LRU, NLRU, Random

## x86 common instruction

* push: decrement stack pointer and place src on stack
  * pop
* call: store ip
  * relative: displacement relative to next instruction
* ret:
  * go to ip on stack
* lea: store effective address to reg
* enter / leave: function call meta func
  * push ebp; mov ebp,esp
  * mov esp, ebp; pop ebp 

## x86 instrcution format

* instruction consists of
  * Prefix
  * Opcode
  * MOD-REG-R/M
  * SIB
  * disp
  * immediate
* cpu mode
  * Real mode
  * Protect mode / Long compatibility mode
  * Long mode
* register
  * a c d b sp bp si di
    * bp: base pointerï¼Œ stack bottom
    * sp: stack pointer, stack top
  * ip: instruction pointer
    * point to next instruction
  * segement pointer?
  * 32 bit: e*
  * 64 bit: r*
    * 8 x general purpose reg

## addressing

* MOD-REG-R/M: determine memory address
  * reg can used as register operand or opcode extension
  * mod 11: rm only
  * mod 00, 01, 10: 0, 1, 4 byte disp
    * rm 100: + SIB
    * mod 00, rm 101: disp32
    * other: + rm
* Scale-Index-Base (SIB):
  * scale: 1 2 4 8
  * index and base refer to registers
  * = base + index * scale
    * index 100: index = 0
    * mod 00, base 101: base = disp32

## abi design

* C language data type model
  * ILP32: int, long, pointer = 32 bit
  * LP64: long, pointer = 64 bit
* x32 abi:
  * reduce cache usage
  * limited memory range

## misc

* [instruction simulation](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html)
* model specific register
  * `rdmsr`
* intel c2000 stepping
  * check chip stepping `setpci -s 00:00.0 8.w`

## assembler

armasm
gas 
has different syntax

* assembler seems to focus on binary generation
* section & func
* export
* how the section is organized is determined by linker
