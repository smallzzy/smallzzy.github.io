## how sin and cos is computed

* LUT
* CORDIC
* power series

\\[
\cos(x) = 1 - {x^{2} \over 2!} + {x^{4} \over 4!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!} \\
\sin(x) = x - {x^{3} \over 3!} + {x^{5} \over 5!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}
\\]

## usb

* usb device works in master/slave arch
* otg: device determines its role based on which end of cable it is on
  * master: A device, ID pin grounded
  * slave: B device, ID pin floating
  * device role can be changed later via SRP or HNP
* usb c
  * A plug: downstream facing port (DFP)
  * B plug: upstream facing port (UFP)
  * dual role port (DRP)
    * otg is considered DRP in usb c's term
  * CC: configuration pin, used to determine role
    * pull up resistor -> DFP
    * pull down resistor -> UFP
    * DRP will alternate its resistor setting
  * Vconn: power for active cable
* Power domain
  * Source vs Sink
  * Host will assume the role of source
  * for otg, source is set via specific pull down resistance
  * for usb c, source is negotiated over USB PD

## misc

* brown out condition: a small drop in supply voltage can cause unstable behavior
* emc: electromagnetic compatibility
  * [learnemc](https://learnemc.com/the-most-important-emc-design-guidelines)
  * https://techweb.rohm.com/knowledge/emc
  * loop area, bypass cap, lc oscillation
* capacitor orientation
  * metallized polypropylene cap has a metal shielded end. Usually unmarked.
  * Should connect shielded end to lower impedance circuit. Lower noise?
* grounding
  * separate ground for analog and digital
  * ferrite bead + inductor?

## pci

* pci defines two header types
  * type 0 for device
  * type 1 for switch
* base address register (BAR) is defined in header
  * bit 0 = 0 for MEM, 1 for IO
  * for MEM, bit 1-2 set address range, bit 3 = prefetchable
  * determine memory size by:
    * write 0xFF and read back
    * clear information bits
    * invert and increment by 1 -> 16 byte to 2 GB
* BAR is determined at boot
  * map device address

* configuration?

## pcie

* extended Capability
  * resizable BAR

### topology

PCIe slot can be connected to PCH or switch instead of directly to CPU.
Here are some commands to reveal such problem.

```bash
dmidecode # read hardware infomation
lspci # -t tree, -v LnkCap -> PCIe current link speed
lshw
lstopo # show system topology
```
  
* PCI devices are addressed in 32 bits?
  * domain (16 bits), bus (8 bits), device (5 bits) and function (3 bits)
  * `setpci -s 00:02.1 F4.B`
    * `00:02.1`
    * offset `F4`
    * B, W, L = 1, 2, 4 bytes
* bifurcation

### Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)

### Message Signalled Interrupts

* pin-based interrupt (PCI)
  * pin count is limited -> cost
  * pins are shared between devices
  * out of band interrupt might race with in band data
    * requires synchronization -> performance cost
* MSI (PCI 2.2), MSI-X (PCI 3.0)
  * no interrupt pin in PCIe
  * device send data to processor as part of the interrupt
    * which determines what interrupt to trigger
