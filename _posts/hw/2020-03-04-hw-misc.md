## how sin and cos is computed

* LUT
* CORDIC
* power series

\\[
\cos(x) = 1 - {x^{2} \over 2!} + {x^{4} \over 4!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!} \\
\sin(x) = x - {x^{3} \over 3!} + {x^{5} \over 5!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}
\\]

## usb

* usb device works in master/slave arch
* otg: device determines its role based on which end of cable it is on
  * master: A device, ID pin grounded
  * slave: B device, ID pin floating
  * device role can be changed later via SRP or HNP
* usb c
  * A plug: downstream facing port (DFP)
  * B plug: upstream facing port (UFP)
  * dual role port (DRP)
    * otg is considered DRP in usb c's term
  * CC: configuration pin, used to determine role
    * pull up resistor -> DFP
    * pull down resistor -> UFP
    * DRP will alternate its resistor setting
  * Vconn: power for active cable
* Power domain
  * Source vs Sink
  * Host will assume the role of source
  * for otg, source is set via specific pull down resistance
  * for usb c, source is negotiated over USB PD

## misc

* brown out condition: a small drop in supply voltage can cause unstable behavior
* emc: electromagnetic compatibility
  * [learnemc](https://learnemc.com/the-most-important-emc-design-guidelines)
  * https://techweb.rohm.com/knowledge/emc
  * loop area, bypass cap, lc oscillation
* capacitor orientation
  * metallized polypropylene cap has a metal shielded end. Usually unmarked.
  * Should connect shielded end to lower impedance circuit. Lower noise?
* grounding
  * separate ground for analog and digital
  * ferrite bead + inductor?

## x86

* instruction consists of
  * Prefix
  * Opcode
  * MOD-REG-R/M
  * SIB
  * disp
  * immediate
* cpu mode
  * Real mode
  * Protect mode / Long compatibility mode
  * Long mode
* register
  * a c d b sp bp si di
    * bp: base pointerï¼Œ stack bottom
    * sp: stack pointer, stack top
  * ip: instruction pointer
    * point to next instruction
  * segement pointer?
  * 32 bit: e*
  * 64 bit: r*
    * 8 x general purpose reg

### 32 bit addressing

* MOD-REG-R/M: determine memory address
  * reg can used as register operand or opcode extension
  * mod 11: rm only
  * mod 00, 01, 10: 0, 1, 4 byte disp
    * rm 100: + SIB
    * mod 00, rm 101: disp32
    * other: + rm
* Scale-Index-Base (SIB):
  * scale: 1 2 4 8
  * index and base refer to registers
  * = base + index * scale
    * index 100: index = 0
    * mod 00, base 101: base = disp32 

[OSDEV](https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64_Instruction_Encoding)  

### common instruction

* push: decrement stack pointer and place src on stack
  * pop
* call: store ip
  * relative: displacement relative to next instruction
* ret:
  * go to ip on stack
* lea: store effective address to reg
* enter / leave: function call meta func
  * push ebp; mov ebp,esp
  * mov esp, ebp; pop ebp 

### instruction simulation

https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-software-development-emulator.html

model specific register

## general design problem

* pipeline hazard
  * control hazard: unpredictable branching
  * dependency hazard: 
    * forwarding
  * structural hazard: station being occupied
* cache:
  * size
    * cache line size
    * total size
  * access pattern / hit rate
  * associativity
  * replacement policy
    * LRU, NLRU, Random

## pci

* pci defines two header types
  * type 0 for device
  * type 1 for switch
* base address register (BAR) is defined in header
  * bit 0 = 0 for MEM, 1 for IO
  * for MEM, bit 1-2 set address range, bit 3 = prefetchable
  * determine memory size by:
    * write 0xFF and read back
    * clear information bits
    * invert and increment by 1 -> 16 byte to 2 GB
* BAR is determined at boot
  * map device address

## pcie

* extended Capability
  * resizable BAR

### topology

PCIe slot can be connected to PCH or switch instead of directly to CPU.
Here are some commands to reveal such problem.

```bash
dmidecode # read hardware infomation
lspci # -t tree, -v LnkCap -> PCIe current link speed
lshw
lstopo # show system topology
```
  
* PCI devices are addressed in 32 bits?
  * domain (16 bits), bus (8 bits), device (5 bits) and function (3 bits)
  * `setpci -s 00:02.1 F4.B`
    * `00:02.1`
    * offset `F4`
    * B, W, L = 1, 2, 4 bytes
* bifurcation

### Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)

### Message Signalled Interrupts

* pin-based interrupt (PCI)
  * pin count is limited -> cost
  * pins are shared between devices
  * out of band interrupt might race with in band data
    * requires synchronization -> performance cost
* MSI (PCI 2.2), MSI-X (PCI 3.0)
  * no interrupt pin in PCIe
  * device send data to processor as part of the interrupt
    * which determines what interrupt to trigger
