## how sin and cos is computed

- LUT
- CORDIC
- power series

\\[
\cos(x) = 1 - {x^{2} \over 2!} + {x^{4} \over 4!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!} \\
\sin(x) = x - {x^{3} \over 3!} + {x^{5} \over 5!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}
\\]

## misc

- brown out condition: a small drop in supply voltage can cause unstable behavior
- emc: electromagnetic compatibility
  - [learnemc](https://learnemc.com/the-most-important-emc-design-guidelines)
  - https://techweb.rohm.com/knowledge/emc
  - loop area, bypass cap, lc oscillation
- capacitor orientation
  - metallized polypropylene cap has a metal shielded end. Usually unmarked.
  - Should connect shielded end to lower impedance circuit. Lower noise?
- grounding
  - separate ground for analog and digital
  - ferrite bead + inductor?

### lower power design

- clock gating
- gate sizing / threhold voltage
- balance path delay:
  - glitch: during setup time, some gates might be switching uncessarily
  - 1. add buffer so that output changes at same time
  - 2. change propagation delay
- reduce transition:
  - grey code: increment only changes one bit
  - inversion coding: when hamming distance > n/2, set inversion on instead of inverting every single bit
- power domain:
  - common power format
