## pci config space

- 4 KB total config space size
- 0-64 byte config space header
  - two header types are defined
  - type 0 for device
  - type 1 for switch
  - contains BAR info
- the rest is for capabilities?
  - 64-256 byte standard config space
  - above 256 byte extended config space

## BAR  

- base address register (BAR) is defined in header
  - bit 0 = 0 for MEM, 1 for IO
  - for MEM, bit 1-2 set address range, bit 3 = prefetchable
  - determine memory size by:
    - write 0xFF and read back
    - clear information bits
    - invert and increment by 1 -> 16 byte to 2 GB
- traditionally BAR is determined at boot
  - map device address to io memory
- one of the extended capability is resizable BAR

## topology

PCIe lane might be provided by PCH or switch instead of CPU.
Here are some commands to look at the topology.

```bash
dmidecode # read hardware infomation
lspci
# -t tree
# -v
# LnkCap -> PCIe supported link speed
# LnkSta -> PCIe current link speed
lshw
lstopo # show system topology
```

- PCH lanes might show up in the same root port despite different physical topo
- PCI devices are addressed in 32 bits
  - domain (16 bits), bus (8 bits), device (5 bits) and function (3 bits)
  - `setpci -s 00:02.1 F4.B`
    - `00:02.1`
    - offset `F4`
    - B, W, L = 1, 2, 4 bytes
- bifurcation: allow a wider port to be split between devices
- power state / link training is controlled by hardware
  - with null packet continously sent if on
  - link speed can be tuned down for low power

## Message Signalled Interrupts

- pin-based interrupt (PCI)
  - pin count is limited -> cost
  - pins are shared between devices
  - out of band interrupt might race with in band data
    - requires synchronization -> performance cost
- MSI (PCI 2.2), MSI-X (PCI 3.0)
  - no interrupt pin in PCIe
  - device send data to processor as part of the interrupt
    - which determines what interrupt to trigger
