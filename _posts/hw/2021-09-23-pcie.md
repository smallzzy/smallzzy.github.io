## layer

1. Transaction Layer Packet
2. Data Link: make sure that packet is delivered
3. Physical Layer

## pci configuration space

- 4 KB total config space size
- 0-64 byte config space header
  - two header types are defined
    - type 0 for device
    - type 1 for switch
  - contains BAR info
- the rest is for capabilities?
  - 64-256 byte standard config space
  - above 256 byte extended config space

## BAR

- base address register (BAR) will specify
  - memory type
  - memory size
- defined in pci config space
  - bit 0 = 0 for MEM, 1 for IO
  - for MEM
    - bit 1-2 set address range -> where the assigned address should locate at
      - 0x0: 32-bit, 0x10: 64-bit
    - bit 3 = prefetchable -> cacheable
- determine memory size by:
  - write 0xFF and read back
  - clear information bits
  - invert and increment by 1 -> 16 byte to 2 GB
  - memory size also specify memory alignment requirement

- traditionally address is determined during enumeration
  - Root port is responsible to enumerate all devices on the bus
- one of the extended capability is resizable BAR

### IO BAR

- IO type is for backwards support
- only support Non-posted
- only support 32-bit

## topology

```bash
dmidecode # read hardware infomation
lspci
# -t -> show as tree structure
# -v -> use more v for increased verbosity
# -s -> select certain address for printing
# LnkCap -> PCIe supported link speed
# LnkSta -> PCIe current link speed
lshw
lstopo # show system topology
```

- PCI devices are addressed in 32 bits
  - domain (16 bits), bus (8 bits), device (5 bits) and function (3 bits)
  - `setpci -s 00:02.1 F4.B`
    - `00:02.1`
    - offset `F4`
    - B, W, L = 1, 2, 4 bytes
- PCIe lane might be provided by PCH. But they still show up in one root port
  - NUMA implication?

## misc

- bifurcation: allow a wider port to be split between devices
  - this is a feature that need support from pcie controller
- bus mastering: allow device to post TLP
  - Command Register bit 2
  - peer device has its own DMA instead of using CPU
  - requires bus arbitration
- Posted vs Non-Posted:
  - Non-posted request need to wait for completion explictly

## Message Signalled Interrupts

- pin-based interrupt (PCI)
  - pin count is limited -> cost
  - pins are shared between devices
  - out of band interrupt might race with in band data
    - requires synchronization -> performance cost
- MSI (PCI 2.2), MSI-X (PCI 3.0)
  - no interrupt pin in PCIe
  - device send data to processor as part of the interrupt
    - which determines what interrupt to trigger

MXS824 PCIE switch

- power state / link training is controlled by hardware
  - with null packet being sent continously if power on?
  - link speed can be tuned down for low power?
