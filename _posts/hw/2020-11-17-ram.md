## technology

* transistor
  * SRAM
* capacitor
  * DRAM
* floating gate
  * eeprom: byte programmable
  * flash: block (page) programmable

## Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)

Normally, memory chips are directly driven by controller.

* Rank
  * Create high capacity sticks with older technology
  * i.e. Cannot fit more memory in one chip
  * Let one chip select enable multiple chips on the stick
    * I suppose that the address of each chip can be selected
    * One chip might also provide less bitwidth, thus force the use of rank.
* Channel
  * implemented on memory controller
  * different physical driver for each channel
  * The sticks on the same channel is effectively in one rank

Every chip will introduce some capacitive load to the driver.
To support more memory, the cap load become unacceptable:

* Registered DIMM
  * controller directly connects to register
* Fully Buffered DIMM:
  * Put a driver chip between controller and memory
  * Use high frequency serial connection to this driver chip
    * let driver chip connect to more memory chips
* Load Reduced DIMM:
  * controller connects to buffer before the register. (like in asic)

## bandwidth calculation

* data is transmitted based on Word clock (WCK)
* data rate: SDR, DDR, QDR
  * data can be toggled multiple times on one clock
    * implemented as mutliple phase shifted clock 
  * memory clock = WCK * data rate
* prefetch: 4n, 8n (these are advised prefetch)
  * parallelly fetch from multiple memory
  * serially present data on interface
  * actual prefetch = advised prefetch / data rate ?
  * effective clock = memory clock * actual prefetch
* bank grouping? QAM?
* controller can support wider memory interface
  * i.e. lane, pins
  * bandwidth = effective clock * lane size

## memory controller

AMD infinity fabric
coupled mode -> latency
uncoupled mode -> bandwidth

victim cache: Located in further cache, capture recently evicted cache (victim)

## ecc check

dmidecode -t memory
Total Width > Data Width
total width might be wrong if bios ignored smbios?
