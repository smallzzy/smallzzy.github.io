## technology

* transistor
  * SRAM: hold value with power
  * register file: basicially memory for SRAM
    * decoder + transmission gate
* capacitor
  * DRAM: must be periodically refreshed
* floating gate
  * eeprom: byte programmable
  * flash: block (page) programmable

## Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)

* Channel
  * implemented on CPU memory controller
    * max channel is limited by CPU design
    * each stick will be in one channel
  * each channel will have different driver
* Rank
  * allow controller to select different set of chips
    * max rank per channel is limited by CPU design
    * each stick can provide different rank per stick (1R, 2R)
* Bitwidth
  * each chip might only provide part of Data Width (x4, x8)

Traditionally, memory chips are directly driven by controller.
Every chip will introduce some capacitive load to the driver.
The load become unacceptable when supporting more memory.

* Registered DIMM
  * controller directly connects to register
* Fully Buffered DIMM:
  * Put a driver chip between controller and memory
  * Use high frequency serial connection to this driver chip
    * let driver chip connect to more memory chips
* Load Reduced DIMM:
  * controller connects to buffer before the register. (like in asic)

## bandwidth calculation

* data is transmitted based on Word clock (WCK)
* data rate: SDR, DDR, QDR
  * data can be toggled multiple times on one clock
    * implemented as mutliple phase shifted clock 
  * memory clock = WCK * data rate
* prefetch: 4n, 8n (these are advised prefetch)
  * parallelly fetch from multiple memory
  * serially present data on interface
  * actual prefetch = advised prefetch / data rate ?
  * effective clock = memory clock * actual prefetch
* bank grouping? QAM?
* controller can support wider memory interface
  * i.e. lane, pins
  * bandwidth = effective clock * lane size

## memory controller

### AMD infinity fabric

MCLK: memory 
UCLK: memory controller
FCLK: fabric

* MCLK and UCLK is 1:2 due to ddr
* UCLK vs FCLK
  * same -> coupled mode -> latency
  * diff -> uncoupled mode -> bandwidth
  
## cache replacement policy

victim cache: Located in further cache, capture recently evicted cache (victim)

## ecc check

dmidecode -t memory
Total Width > Data Width
total width might be wrong if bios ignored smbios?

## non volatile memory

- Data Center Persistent Memory Module (DCPMM)
- NVDIMM-P
