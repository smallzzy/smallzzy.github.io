## LDAP

Copied from [ubuntu documentation](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-ldap). Highlight on keywords.

* A directory is a tree of data `entries` that is hierarchical in nature and is called the `Directory Information Tree (DIT)`.
* An entry consists of a set of `attributes`.
* An attribute has a key (a name/description) and one or more values.
* Every attribute must be defined in at least one `objectClass`.
* Attributes and objectClasses are defined in schemas (an objectClass is actually considered as a special kind of attribute).
* Each entry has a unique identifier: its `Distinguished Name (DN or dn)`. This, in turn, consists of a `Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)` followed by the parent entry’s DN.
* The entry’s DN is not an attribute. It is not considered part of the entry itself.

## clarification

* LDAP
  * provides a directory service
  * LDIF: LDAP Data Interchange Protocol
  * X.500?
* Microsoft Active Directory
  * database for various directory services
  * AD Domian Service: DNS + authentication
  * AD LDS: implements LDAP
* OpenLDAP
  * implements LDAP
* other services can use LDAP as a backend to store data

### LDIF

* dn: distinguished name
  * uniquely identify each enry
  * read from right to left
  * consist of cn, ou, dc
* dc: domain component
* ou: organizational unit
* cn: common name

## OpenLDAP

```
apt install slapd ldap-utils
dkpg-reconfigure slapd
```

* [layout](https://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/slapdconf2.html#Configuration%20Layout)
  * The slapd configuration is stored as a special LDAP directory with a predefined schema and DIT
* Data is stored in several `olcDatabase`s
  * `{-1}frontend`: store default configs for all db
  * `{0}config`: slapd config db
    * known as `cn=config`
  * `{1}mdb`: user db
* During configuration, we setup the user db
  * the provided domain name becomes base dn
    * `example.com` -> `dc=example,dc=com`
  * the provided passwd becomes `olcRootPW`
    * `olcRootDN` is `cn=admin,dc=exmample,dc=com`
* `olcAccess` controls how users can access one db
  * `olcRootDN` always has full access to that db
  * `cn=config` is limited to local root by default

## change olcRootPW

```
# generate hashed passwd
slappasswd

# root_pw.ldif
dn: olcDatabase={0}config,cn=config
changetype: modify
add: olcRootPW
olcRootPW: {SSHA}cZbRoOhRew8MBiWGSEOiFX0XqbAQwXUr
```

## ldap-tools

* ldapsearch
  * `-LLL`: reduce display data
  * `-b`: search base
* ldapwhoami
  * `-D`: bind dn
    * otherwise, dn = anonymous
  * auth
    * `-x`: plain text auth
    * `-Y`: SASL method
    * `-Y EXTERNAL`: only works for `ldapi`
  * `-W`: interactive password
  * `-H`
    * `ldap://` tcp
    * `ldapi:///` local unix socket
  * `-ZZ`: force ssl
* ldapadd
* `man 5 ldap.conf`
  * the default should be `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf`
  * but other package might defined addtional files
  * pam -> `/etc/ldap.conf`
  * sudo -> `/etc/sudo-ldap.conf`

[ldapscripts](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-ldap-usage)

## ldap tls

* ldap's cert is set in its own conf instead of ca-certificate
* deploy root certificate to server
* `openssl s_client -connect domain:port -showcerts`
  * `--starttls ldap` force tls connection
* server can force tls connection `olcSecurity: tls=1`
  * breaks `ldapi:///` -> do not force tls

## ldap pam

* several methods exist for authentication
  * based on direct ldap: libnss-ldap + libpam-ldap
  * based on nslcd: libnss-ldapd + libpam-ldapd
  * based on sssd
* sssd seems to be the most integrated solution
