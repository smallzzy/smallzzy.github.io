## unicode

- `unicode`: assign numerical value (`code point`) to symbols (`abstract character`) in different language
- unicode can be encoded in different ways
  - `UCS-2`: single 16 bit value -> `UTF-16`
    - not enough for unicode
  - `UTF-16`: one or two 16 bit values
    - Byte Order Mark (`BOM`): endianess
    - Used in windows 
  - `UTF-8`: one to four bytes
- Some abstract characters cannot be encoded by a single code point
  - `Grapheme cluster`, `Normalization`
- length of a unicode string changes depending on what is being counted

## code page

- In comparison, `code page` only contain assignment for some languages.
  - If a senstence is a mix of different languages, it cannot be represented
- On Windows, it is called `ANSI code pages`
