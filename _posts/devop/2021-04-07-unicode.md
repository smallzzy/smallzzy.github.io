## unicode

- `unicode`: assign numerical value (`code point`) to symbols (`abstract character`) in different language
  - the basic multilingual plane (`BMP`), and 16 supplementary planes, each with 2 ^ 16 code points
  - represented as `U+<hex>`
- unicode is encoded to save bits
- Some abstract characters can be represented in multiple ways
  - Character + Combining character `Grapheme cluster`
    - canonical equivalent (NF)
  - Look-alikes:
    - compatibility equivalent (NFK)
  - `Normalization`: a process to guarantee that a given character is always represented by the same code point
    - composing (C) vs decomposing (D) (i.e to expand into multiple characters or not)
- length of a unicode string changes depending on what is being counted
  - byte, code point, character

## UCS-2, UCS-4

- UCS-2 encode code points with 2 bytes
  - not enough for unicode, which is `17 \* 2 ^ 16`
- UCS-4 encode code points with 4 bytes

## UTF-16

- `UTF-16`: one or two 16 bit values
  - Byte Order Mark (`BOM`) to detemine endianess
- `BMP` can be encoded with one 16 bit value
  - `BMP` has openings on `0xD800` to `0xDFFF` just for UTF-16
  - As a result, `Unicode scalar values` exclude this region
- For supplementary planes, encode 10 bits in high surrogate + low surrogate
  - `16 \* 2 ^ 16 = 2 ^ 20`

## UTF-8

- encode code points with 1 to 4 bytes
- surragate from UTF-16 is not valid UTF-8
  - as they are not part of `Unicode scalar values`

| First code point | Last code point | Byte 1   | Byte 2   | Byte 3   | Byte 4   |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| U+0000           | U+007F          | 0xxxxxxx |
| U+0080           | U+07FF          | 110xxxxx | 10xxxxxx |
| U+0800           | U+FFFF          | 1110xxxx | 10xxxxxx | 10xxxxxx |
| U+10000          | U+10FFFF        | 11110xxx | 10xxxxxx | 10xxxxxx | 10xxxxxx |

### CESU-8

- allow surrogate from UTF-16 to be represented as 3 bytes

## code page

- In comparison, `code page` only contain assignment for some languages.
  - If a senstence is a mix of different languages, it cannot be represented
- On Windows, it is called `ANSI code pages`
