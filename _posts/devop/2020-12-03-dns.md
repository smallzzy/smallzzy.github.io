## dns basic

* iterative query: server will give a referral to other dns to continue query
* recursive query: server will query other dns for a complete answer
  * DNS amplification
  * DNS cache poisoning
* zone transfer: `AXFR`
  * replicate DNS database across servers
* reverse look up zone:
  * `<reverse ip octet>.in-addr.arpa`
  * `207.126.67.129` -> `129.67.126.207.in-addr.arpa`
* Resource Record Set(RRset)
  * associated with one zone

## Bind9

```
/etc/bind/named.conf
/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones
/etc/bind/named.conf.options
/etc/bind/named.conf.local
/etc/bind/named.conf.log
```

[Document](https://bind9.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference.html)

## setup 

```
bind9-dyndb-ldap
```

## tool

`dig`
`host`
`nslookup`
`named-checkconf`
`named-checkzone`

## conf

* `acl`: subnets for access control
* `options`:
  * `directory`: working directory
  * `allow-query`
  * `recursion`, `allow-recursion`
  * `allow-transfer`
  * `forwarders`
  * `query-source`: no frozen port, security?
* `zone`
  * `type`
    * `primary`: master copy
    * `secondary`: use primary to update its copy
  * `file`

## zone file

* created based on `/etc/bind/db.local`
* `$TTL`: default ttl
* name ttl record_class	record_type record_data
  * `@`: current domain placeholder
  * name can be left blank to inherit from previous record
    * name can end with `.` for a full domain name
    * otherwise, it is relative to current domain
  * ttl is optional
* `SOA`: start of authority
  * controls the zone transfer
  * `MNAME`: primary name server
    * UPDATE, NOTIFY?
  * `RNAME`: admin email
    * dot in user name are escaped with `\.`
* `NS`: nameserver
  * idk, contact this ns for the requested zone
    * example for com dns `foo.com. IN NS <registar's dns>`
  * multiple ns for the same zone -> redundency
  * must contain A record for ns ip
  * should contain SOA if this server is one of the NS
* `MX`: mail server
* `A`, `AAAA`: the ip for a domain
* `CNAME`: restart query using CNAME
* `PTR`: reverse look up

note that sub domain might not need to be resolved completely

## dns round robin


## ddns (RFC2136)

* can delete everything in a zone except SOA and one NS
* cannot add new zone

### dhcp to dns

* dhcp server update dns record
  * TSIG given to dhcp server only
* dhcp service have no authentication
  * separate vlan for trusted area
