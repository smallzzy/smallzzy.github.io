## common

- `echo`:
  - `-e` interpret backslash escapes,
  - `-n` do not output the trailing newline

- `grep`: `-B` before, `-A` after, `-C` context
  - `v`: remove pattern

- `wc`
- `uniq`: remove duplicated lines. can count by `-c`
- `sort`: `-z` separate by null

- `less +f`
  - `ctrl+c` detach, `shift f` go to end
  - `tail -f`

```bash
# locate script path
SCRIPT=`realpath $0`
SCRIPTPATH=`dirname $SCRIPT`
```

## shell

- `{1..10}` generate numbers
  - `seq 1 4 10`
- `${}` variable name
  - `$0`, `$1`: input arguments
- `$()` interpret as command
- `&` means to place program in background?
  - `nohup`
- `|` pipe and `>` redirection is handled by shell
  - processes are placed in one program group
  - they are not affect by sudo
- `sh -c ""` run string as bash command
- array: `SAMPLE=(a b c)`
  - different member are separate by space
  - or use quote mark to store a long string with space in it
  - extracted via `${SAMPLE[@]}`

- `ctrl+`: shell short cut
  - `u`: remove before cursor
  - `k`: remvoe after cursor
  - `w`: remove previous word
  - `y`: paste removed content
  - `x-e`: edit current content in $EDITOR and run
    - `fc`: edit previous command in $EDITOR
  - `r`: search for previously run command

- `CLEANSTRING=${STRING//[^a-zA-Z0-9]/}`

### script

- during assignment, space matters. `VAR=VALUE`
  - any space charater will cause value to become another statement
  - to write a value with space, a quoted string is needed
- shell is able to interpret
  - dollar sign($) for variable name
  - backtick(\`)
  - backslash(\\) to escape other charater
  - exclamation mark(!) for history expansion
- quoted string:
  - double quote string still allow interpret but can also contain space
  - single quote string does not allow interpret anything
    - thus, we cannot nest single quote. (which ends the string immediately)
  - `$'string'` interpert according to C standard
- when a variable is used in a statement
  - it is replaced with its value asap
  - it is interpreted as a single argument to the program
    - despite all the space that might be in that variable
    - we can handled it with `xargs` or with array

- when writing a script,
  - strings automatically concat with others
  - quote ends as soon as a matching quote mark appear
  - quote mark around string does not exist in output unless escaped
- `|` and `&` is for condition
  - use `eval string` to use the shell behavior
- `||` and `&&` is for conditional command running

## find

`find /some/directory`

- if given a absolute path, find will return absolute path
- `-name "*.txt"`
  - `-iname`: case insensitive match
- for complex pattern `-regextype sed -regex ""`
- `-exec cmd option {} \;`
  - `{}` is replaced with found file
  - `\;` mark the end of cmd
- `-maxdepth 1`: recursion depth
- `-type`: file, directory
- `-print`: print file name on its own line
  - `-printf '%p'`
  - `-print0` separate by null
- `perm` `user` `group`
- `-size`
  - `+-` for range
  - `bcwkMG`
    - 512 byte block
    - byte
    - 2 byte word
    - kilobyte
    - megabyte
    - gigabyte

## sed

- search and replace pattern in file
- mutliple patterns separated by `;`
- `/predicate/!s/regex/replace/flag`
- regex:
  - wildcard: `.*?`
  - group: `\( \)`
  - separate: `\|`
- replace:
  - group `\0` entire match, `\1` first group ..
- flag:
  - some number: match a certain time
  - `g`: match all
  - `m`: multi line
  - `p`: print
- options:
  - `-n`: do not print except stated
  - `-E`: extended regex format

## xargs

- separate string into multiple arguments
- by default, split string by newline and blanks
  - `-0`: split by null
- by default, send one argument at a time
  - `-n <>`: send several arguments together
  - use `sh -c 'echo "$2" "$1"'` to re-order argument
- `-I <>`: use specified identifier
- `-p`: interactive mode. Print command and let user confirm
- `-t`: verbose mode. Print command before execute

## awk

- operate on table like text file
- included variable
  - FS, OFS, NF: field separator, output separator, number of field
  - RS, ORS, NR: record
  - FNR
  - FILENAME
- action
  - `BEGIN {}` `{}` `END {}`: three stage of action
  - `'/regex/'` pattern matching
    - `$0 ~ pattern` field matching
  - `print`, `length`: function
- single quote for actions
