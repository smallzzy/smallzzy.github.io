## basics

- errno:
  - thread local
  - never cleared until actual error

## system limits

```c
<unistd.h> // compile time
sysconf()
pathconf() fpathconf()
```

## file

- execution bit:
  - for file, become executable
  - for directory, you can access its content (read allow you to ls)
  - `chmod +X`: only apply x for folder
- hard link: create a file with the same inode number
  - inode is unique on one device. Thus, hard link does not work across drives.
  - also, reference counting is necessary
- symbol link: create a symbolic file that points to another file
  - `ln -s`, `-r, --relative`
- bind mount: make a folder available at another position
  - there are possible drawbacks when having the same folder appear twice in the system
  - rbind: bind recursively
- loop mount: make a file accessible as a block device
  - if the file contains an entire file system,
    it can then be mounted as a disk device

### uid

- RUID (real)
  - actual owner of a process
- EUID (effective)
  - authority of a process is determined according to EUID
- SUID (set)
  - When a command with SUID bit is run,
    its EUID become that of the owner of the file,
    rather than that of the user who is running it.
  - `rws` for SUID + x, `rwS` for SUID only

- `chmod +s`
  - for file: apply SUID
  - for directory: the file created in this directory will have same group as this directory, instead of have user's group
- `access` check if RUID has capability
  - by default, will follow symbolic link
- suid will not work for things which need a interpreter ex. script
- `ltrace` does not work because of security

### sticky bit

- used for shared directories
- can create, read and execute files owned by other users
- but cannot remove files owned by other users
- `chmod +t`

### acl

```
# change default acl
setfacl -d -m g:basic:rwx .
# remove entry from acl
setfacl -x
# remove acl
setfacl -bn
```

### attribute

`chattr`

- `A`: do not update atime record
- `S`: changes are synchronously write to disk
- `a`: only open in append mode
- `i`: cannot be modified (no renaming, no symbolic link, no execution)
- `j`: write journal before content
- `t`: no tail-merging (multiple tail block can be merged to reduce disk usage)

[Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattr)

### fd

- file status flags:
  - `O_SYNC`:
    - when fd `close` fail, data is not guaranteed to be written
  - `O_APPEND`:
    - cannot lseek -> gurantee that write is sequential
- file descriptor flags: `fnctl`
  - `FD_CLOEXEC`: if set, fd is closed when `exec()`
    - prevent fd leak to child process
- shared access:
  - fd can point to same file -> `dup()`
  - file can be open multiple times
  - lseek() + read() / write is not atomic
  - pread(), pwrite()
- umask: set file permission for various syscall
  - `mode & ~umask`
  - can be read from `/proc/pid/status` and `/proc/self/status`
- additional action
  - `fnctl`, `ioctl`

- stdio can be treated the same way as other fd
  - we can pass `/proc/self/` `/dev/fd/`
  - some program use `-` to differentiate read from stdin
    - such as `cat`

## io mode

- blocking
- non-blocking: O_NONBLOCK
  - polling mode
  - partial success
  - EAGAIN
- multiplexing
  - select: FDSET
  - poll: fd array
  - epoll: change fds while waiting
- signal based io: SIGIO
  - check if able to read / write, do it after signal
- async: `aio_`
  - read / write first, check result later
  - EINPROGRESS

### stdio

- input / output stream
- buffer
  - line: flush when receiving line end
    - associated with terminal
  - full: flush when buffer is full
    - associated with disk file
    - pipe
  - none
- buffer can cause problem
  - leftover buffer after fork
  - unexpected buffer where no one flushes

## process

the kernel starts as a dummy process 0
the first process to run is `init` as process 1
`SysV` `systemd`

- `fork`: duplicate the current process context
  - will copy the address space
- `exec`: replace current context with new process
- `wait`: wait for process return
- `clone`: similar to fork, but share the address space

### subprocess

- if a parent does not read its child process exit state (wait),
  - the child become zombie after it finished execution
  - if we do not want zombie
    - we can fork twice so that child is orphaned instead.
    - if we ignore child state change signal, the terminal state will not be saved
      - SIG_IGN SIGCLD
  - `ps aux | grep Z`
- if a parent exit before its child process,
  - the child is transfered to `init` (orphaned)
  - `init` will clean up periodically
  - orphaned process get SIGHUP and SIGCONT
- daemon process
  - let child process become its own session

### session

- parent process id `ppid`
- process group `pgid`
  - `getpgid()` / `setpgid()`
  - pipelined process can be placed into one group
- session `sid`
  - `setsid()` create new session
    - the process become the session leader
    - network hang up is sent to session leader
  - a session can have one controlling terminal
- controlling terminal: some tty device
  - `/dev/tty`: current tty device
  - foreground / background process group
    - terminal send signal to the foreground pg `tpgid`
    - `tcgetpgrp` / `tcsetpgrp`
    - bg can talk to `/dev/tty`
- job control
  - when reading in background, process get SIGTTIN
    - if orphaned, read gets EIO
  - when writing in background, process get SIGTTOU

## signal

~~signal, pause, setjmp, longjmp~~

- signal is reset to default after trigger
- signal cannot be turned off
- system call will be interrupted
  - might auto restart
- reentrant function: some func cannot be used because their use of global struct

sigaction, sigsuspend, sigsetjmp, siglongjmp,

- sigaction does not reset
- sigaction allow mask
  - automatically masked unless SA_NODEFER
  - mask is inherit through fork so we need to make sure that we only attach handler when necessary
- sa_flags:
  - SA_RESTART, SA_INTERRUPT: default to restart
  - SA_SIGINFO: more info for signal (also, enable signal queue)
- sigsuspend is atomic:
  - race between signal set and pause
- jmp needs to make sure that mask is cleared

### signal note

- async signal safe != thread safe
  - thread is in band, thread safe can be achieved with mutex
  - signal is out of band, reentrant cannot have broken global state
  - handle signal in special thread
- when ignoring SIGCLD / SIGCHLD, will not generate zombie
  - SIGCLD:
    - if child can be waited, signal is triggered immediately
      - only set signal after wait
  - SIGCHLD:
    - generate when child state actually changes?
- SIGHUP: does not make sense for daemon process
  - so they are usually used to reload config

## pthread

pthread_atfork()

strerror_r()

## ipc

- pipe
- fifo, named pipe
- socket
  - [post for socket]()

## memory mapped io

- `mmap()`
- `shm_open()`
  - create fd which is not back by actual file on disk
  - on linux, equivalent to create file in `/dev/shm`
- `memfd_create()`
  - similar to shm_open, but the name does not refer to actual file
