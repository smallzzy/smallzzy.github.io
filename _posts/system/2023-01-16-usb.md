## usb

- usb device works in master/slave arch
- otg: device determines its role based on which end of cable it is on
  - master: A device, ID pin grounded
  - slave: B device, ID pin floating
  - device role can be changed later via SRP or HNP
- usb c
  - A plug: downstream facing port (DFP)
  - B plug: upstream facing port (UFP)
  - dual role port (DRP)
    - otg is considered DRP in usb c's term
  - CC: configuration pin, used to determine role
    - pull up resistor -> DFP
    - pull down resistor -> UFP
    - DRP will alternate its resistor setting
  - Vconn: power for active cable
- Power domain
  - Source vs Sink
  - Host will assume the role of source
  - for otg, source is set via specific pull down resistance
  - for usb c, source is negotiated over USB PD

## device classes

- USB Video Class (UVC, 0Eh)
- Media (MTP, 06h)
- USB Mass Storage (08h)
- USB CDC (02h), USB CDC-Data (0Ah)?
  - ACM - virtual com
  - NCM - Ethernet Adapter
- RDNIS network

## Linux USB Gadget (legacy)

First the device's USB controller needs to support this in hardware.
Search for "OTG mode" or "dwc2" together with your board's model.

(As a general rule, full-size type-A ports will never be able to act as a device.)

Once you have enabled the necessary hardware (e.g. loaded drivers for the dwc2 controller)
you can then load one of the "gadget" drivers in Linux.
There is `g_mass_storage` for emulating a USB storage device,
`g_serial` for emulating a USB-to-serial converter,
`g_ether` for emulating a USB-Ethernet adapter, and quite a few others.

```bash
# Mount configfs
mount -t configfs none /sys/kernel/config
cd /sys/kernel/config/usb_gadget/

# Create gadget
mkdir g2
cd g2

# Use Toradex vendor and product id
echo 0x1b67 > idVendor
echo 0x400c > idProduct

# English language strings...
mkdir strings/0x409
cat /proc/device-tree/serial-number > strings/0x409/serialnumber
echo "Toradex" > strings/0x409/manufacturer
cat /proc/device-tree/model > strings/0x409/product

# Create configuration
mkdir configs/c.1
mkdir configs/c.1/strings/0x409
echo "USB CDC Ethernet config" > configs/c.1/strings/0x409/configuration

# functions/<name>.<instance name>
# name: acm, gser, obex, rndis, ecm, eem, ncm, ffs, mass_storage, hid
# Create CDC Ethernet (ECM) config
mkdir functions/ecm.usb0
ln -s functions/ecm.usb0 configs/c.1

# enable gadget by bounding to a UDC, usb device controller
UDC_DEV=`ls /sys/class/udc`
echo "$UDC_DEV" > UDC
