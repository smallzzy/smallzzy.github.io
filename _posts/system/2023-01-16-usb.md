[usb id](https://usb-ids.gowdy.us/)

## usb

- usb device works in master/slave arch
- otg: device determines its role based on which end of cable it is on
  - master: A device, ID pin grounded
  - slave: B device, ID pin floating
  - device role can be changed later via SRP or HNP
- usb c
  - A plug: downstream facing port (DFP)
  - B plug: upstream facing port (UFP)
  - dual role port (DRP)
    - otg is considered DRP in usb c's term
  - CC: configuration pin, used to determine role
    - pull up resistor -> DFP
    - pull down resistor -> UFP
    - DRP will alternate its resistor setting
  - Vconn: power for active cable
- Power domain
  - Source vs Sink
  - Host will assume the role of source
  - for otg, source is set via specific pull down resistance
  - for usb c, source is negotiated over USB PD
