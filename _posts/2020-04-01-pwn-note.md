## basic tools

`checksec` to check if some hardening flags are enabled
`gdb_peda`
`pwn_tool`

`kali`
`parrot`
`ModSecurity`

## common technique

1. stack overflow: maybe we can overwrite return pointer on the stack
   1. on x86 stack grows down, array grows up -> we can reach return pointer
   2. for example, we can jump to previously loaded payload
   3. data execution prevention (DEP)
      1. do not allow data on stack to be executed
   4. ASLR makes it hard to get a address
2. return oriented programming (ROP):
   1. instead of running our own payload, run pieces of existing code (gadget)
   2. typically end with `ret`. (subroutine call, library call)
   3. unaligned access can provide more gadget
3. if you have control to printf's format string, you can make it leak info based on parameter passed on stack.
   1. `%p`: pointer address
   2. `%x`: hexadecimal integer
   3. `%s`: string
   4. `%n`: store number of written characters in the pointed location
4. uninitialized data contains info from previous stack
   1. `scanf` takes a pointer as parameter

## get a shell

* from pager commands: `more`, `less`
  * `!'sh'`
  * enter edit mode, press `v`. It will open editor in `$EDITOR`
* from `vim`:
  * navigate to another file `:e`
  * set shell option in vim `:set shell=/bin/sh`
    * and to use it `:shell`

## input sanitization

[unix](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linuxunix-rules-for-naming-file-and-directory-names/): `/><|:&`
[windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file): unix and `"\?*`

## web

* the entire file folder might be exposed
* `robots.txt` might point to something
* [zap](https://www.zaproxy.org/)
* view and edit cookie
* it is possible to intercept file upload and escape frontend check

[html encoding](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)
OWSAP, fiddler, burpsuit

## password salt

Attackers can create a rainbow table which links a hash to its raw text.
Thus, a pure hash on the same password will always collide.
Instead, we use a hash on password + salt.
So that it is hard to construct a rainbow table
Note that the salt can be store in plain text.
Because its only use is to complicate the attack

## php

* session is stored in a session file in server
  * can be accessed via `$_SESSION` after `session_start()`
  * session id is sent to client and store in cookie `PHPSESSID`
* when convert string to number
  * evaluate as float if contain `.eE`
  * evaluate as int otherwise
  * value is given by the initial part of the string
* `==` will apply type juggling to "help" developer
  * if one side of comparision is number, the other side will be juggle to number
  * number like string will be juggle to number
  * always prefer `===` with optional type cast
* `strcmp` will return null if one variable is not string
  * we can force a array if given something like `test[]=1`

## perl

* `param` can return unexpected number of argument
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40273267/is-perl-function-dbh-quote-still-secure

## python functions

string: immutable sequence of unicode
bytes: immutable sequences of integer
bytearray: mutable counterpart of bytes

* if source is a string, a encoding must be given
  * `encode()` `decode()`
* if source is a integer, a array of that size will be initialized
* `fromhex()`: construct bytes from
* `maketrans()` `translate()` -> `tr`
* `binascii` `hexlify()` `unhexlify()`

```
urllib.parse.quote_plus
urllib.parse.unquote_plus
```

## do not trust anything from user

* not even `UA`
* [de-serialization problem](https://paragonie.com/blog/2016/04/securely-implementing-de-serialization-in-php)
* embedding null code -> can cause string processing to end early

## mitm

5 table exist in iptables
filter, nat, mangle, raw and security

https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-options/

tls -> decode key is not possible unless we know certificate
using mitmproxy, we planted our own certificate

In regular mode, mitmproxy must be explicitly set in software

* different software can have different config
* android device will only proxy for browser
  * other app needs to specifically coded to use global proxy

In [transparent mode](https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/), all traffic will go through the proxy.

* sni missing. https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/1846
* some apps implements certificate pinning so that mitm certificate does not work.
  * so we choose to not provide certificate in such case
