## basic

* `[[nodiscard]]`: mark a value so that user cannot ignore it without notice
* remove while iterating
  * erase() return iter to next element
* comp functor requires a [strict weak ordering](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/585396/what-is-meaning-of-strict-weak-ordering-in-laymans-term)
  * i.e. implement `<` rather than `<=`

## preprocessor

```c
# // stringizing
## // token pasting
```

[Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/preprocessor-operators)

Note: If an argument is stringized or concatenated, the prescan does not occur.
i.e. macro argument is not marco-expanded before substitution.

```c
#define xstr(s) str(s)
#define str(s) #s
#define foo 4
str (foo)
     → "foo"
xstr (foo)
     → xstr (4)
     → str (4)
     → "4"
```

## static and const

* `static` means that variable will be shared, which can still be changed in runtime.
  * Thus, require a storage space and cannot be defined in a header file
  * (c++17 has inline variable)
* `const` means that the value cannot change **after creation**
* `static const` means that the value is a constant, which will evaluated during compilation
  * intergral constant has special rules called integral constant expressions
  * for other type, we need specify `constexpr` in the type
    * `constexpr` implicitly make the type to be `const`
    * `constexpr` does not make sense on type without `static`
    * `constexpr` only works on literal type or reference type
      * no object?
* When use `constexpr` in expression, programmer need to make sure that the expression can be evaluated at compile time

## array type

> There is an implicit conversion from lvalues and rvalues of array type to rvalues of pointer type:
> it constructs a pointer to the first element of an array.
> This conversion is used whenever arrays appear in context where arrays are not expected, but pointers are.

> Note that when array-to-pointer decay is applied,
> a multidimensional array is converted to a pointer to its first element
> (e.g., a pointer to its first row or to its first plane):
> array-to-pointer decay is applied only once.

Notice that `new []` always seems to decay once.

## stdio

* `cin` stops at whitespace (w/o removing them)
  * `cin` ignores leading whitespace
* `getline` remove newline from stream
  * `cin.ignore()` to remove character from stream
  * `cin.ignore(80, 'b')` remove upto 80 char until b is also consumed
* `string` + `stringstream` + `std::getline` == `split`
  * `getline` can use a single char as delim

```c++
// makes c and c++ io have independent buffer
ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
// normally, cin / cout flush before operation on the other stream
// untie it means manually flush
cin.tie(NULL);
```

## incompleted type

> A structure type whose members you have not yet specified.
> A union type whose members you have not yet specified.
> An array type whose dimension you have not yet specified.

* EXP57-CPP: do not delete pointers to incomplete classes
* For the following case, the compiler is forced to generate a deleter
* unique_ptr: zero-abstraction -> deleter always generated.
  * ~P()
  * move assignment
  * reset()
  * reset(A*)
* shared_ptr: deleter is needed to construct the control block
  * P(A*)
  * reset(A*)

[complete type requirement](https://howardhinnant.github.io/incomplete.html)

## virtual function

* virtual function should be accessed using pointer or reference
* function call might not be inlined because of vtable
  * it is possible if the type can be determined
* implementation:
  * each class has a static virtual table
  * each virtual object holds a pointer to some virtual table
  * at construction, replace parent's pointer with child's pointer
  * type information & dynamic cast can be embedded in the virtual table

```c
// simple dump function
// %zu for size_t, %p for void *
static void print_object(const char *name, void *this_, size_t size) {
  void **ugly = reinterpret_cast<void**>(this_);
  size_t i;
  printf("created %s at address %p of size %zu\n", name, this_, size);
  for(i = 0 ; i < size / sizeof(void*) ; i++) {
    printf("  pointer[%zu] == %p\n", i, ugly[i]);
  }
}
```

## multi-threading

* use scoped_lock over lock_guard because it is a super set
* unique_lock has the state of not owning any mutex.
  * Thus, it can be default constructed. (error-prune)
* condition_variable:
  * needs to unlock so unique_lock is necessary
  * w/o predicate, a cv can be notified before entering wait state (lost)
    * with predicate, we can check and skip the wait
  * w/o predicate, a cv can Spurious wakeup and escape the wait
    * with predicate, we will re-enter wait
  * predicate needs to be guarded with the same mutex
    * otherwise, a sync is not guaranteed.

## iterator

* when empty, then `begin() == end()`
* `input iterator`, `++r` requires r to be dereferencable
* `bidirectional iterator`, `--r` has the *post condition* that r is dereferenable
* `before_begin` is only defined for `forward_list`

## std::algorithm

* `find_if`, `find_if_not`
  * `find_first_of`, `find_last_of` in `std::string` has a `pos` parameter
* `swap`, `reverse`

## namespace

* anonymous namespace has internal linkage which is the same as `static` in file
* inline namespace expose content to enclosing namespace
  * inject information into the mangled name (ABI) without altering the API
    * used for library versioning
    * ADL does not follow `using`
  * default call accesses inline namespace
  * but a fully qualified call can access any namespace
    * old abi is retained
  * as long as the type does not cross api boundary, a executable can use both namespaces at the same time

## inline keyword

* inline allow function to defined in multiple tranlation unit
  * but we must make sure that all definition match
* since c++17, inline can also be used on variable
  * that means `static` variable does not need a separated cpp file

## exception

* prefere a separate `Init()` and `DeInit()`
  * exception is the only way for constructor to fail
    * but only allocation fail is reasonable for constructor
  * deconstructor should not throw exception in any cases
* all exceptions need to be exposed in abi
  * otherwise, rtti cannot resolve the inheritance chain
* exceptions need to be inherited virtually such that it resolve to a single base class

### noexcept

* when throwing a exception, the programm will call std::terminite
* noexcept on move constructor can improve performance
* conditional noexcept can be used in template class

## reflection vs rtti

With rtti, program is able to work on a set of runtime types.
The set is determined in compile time.

With reflection, program is expected to work on any runtime types
by looking into the data structure during runtime

## virtual function in cpp constructor / destructor [OOP50-CPP]

> the function called is the final overrider in the constructor’s or destructor’s class and not one overriding it in a more-derived class.

During the construction process, the vtable pointer is changed when entering a child class scope.
So, virtual function cannot resolve to correct function.

(Also, member variable does not exist at this point)

## INT02-C

> Integer types smaller than int are promoted when an operation is performed on them

> If the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater than or equal to the rank of the type of the other operand,
> the operand with signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned integer type.

> Otherwise, if the new type is unsigned,
> the value is converted by repeatedly adding or subtracting one more than the maximum value
> that can be represented in the new type until the value is in the range of the new type.

## attribute

`[[deprecated]]`

## gMock

- dependency injection
  - differennt use case might require vastly different contruction parameter
  - inject mock class when testing
- but virutal mock class create inheritance that should not exist
  - static injection via template
  - c++ 20 cocepts

- vs factory / delegation
  - instead of inject object, let the class create it as needed
  - factory allow more procedure calls than constructor
