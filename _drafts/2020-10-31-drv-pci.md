## pci

* pci defines two header types
  * type 0 for device
  * type 1 for switch
* base address register (BAR) is defined in header
  * bit 0 = 0 for MEM, 1 for IO
  * for MEM, bit 1-2 set address range, bit 3 = prefetchable
  * determine memory size by:
    * write 0xFF and read back
    * clear information bits
    * invert and increment by 1 -> 16 byte to 2 GB
* BAR is determined at boot
  * map device address

## pcie

* extended Capability
  * resizable BAR

### Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)

Physial Function: actual pcie device

### Message Signalled Interrupts

* pin-based interrupt (PCI)
  * pin count is limited -> cost
  * pins are shared between devices
  * out of band interrupt might race with in band data
    * requires synchronization -> performance cost
* MSI (PCI 2.2), MSI-X (PCI 3.0)
  * no interrupt pin in PCIe
  * device send data to processor as part of the interrupt
    * which determines what interrupt to trigger
