### Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)

Physial Function: actual pcie device
Virtual Function

### Message Signalled Interrupts

* pin-based interrupt (PCI)
  * pin count is limited -> cost
  * pins are shared between devices
  * out of band interrupt might race with in band data
    * requires synchronization -> performance cost
* MSI (PCI 2.2), MSI-X (PCI 3.0)
  * no interrupt pin in PCIe
  * device send data to processor as part of the interrupt
    * which determines what interrupt to trigger
