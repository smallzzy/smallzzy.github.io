## Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)

Normally, memory chips are directly driven by controller.

* Rank
  * Create high capacity sticks with older technology
  * i.e. Cannot fit more memory in one chip
  * Let one chip select enable multiple chips on the stick
    * I suppose that the address of each chip can be selected
    * One chip might also provide less bitwidth, thus force the use of rank.
* Channel
  * implemented on memory controller
  * different physical driver for each channel
  * The sticks on the same channel is effectively in one rank

Every chip will introduce some capacitive load to the driver.
To support more memory, the cap load become unacceptable:

* Fully Buffered DIMM:
  * Put a driver chip between controller and memory
  * Use high frequency serial connection to this driver chip
    * let driver chip connect to more memory chips
* Load Reduced DIMM:
  * Just buffer the signals (like in asic)
