## how sin and cos is computed

* LUT
* CORDIC
* power series

\\[
\cos(x) = 1 - {x^{2} \over 2!} + {x^{4} \over 4!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n}}{(2n)!} \\
\sin(x) = x - {x^{3} \over 3!} + {x^{5} \over 5!} - \cdots = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^nx^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}
\\]

## usb

* usb device works in master/slave arch
* otg: device determines its role based on which end of cable it is on
  * master: A device, ID pin grounded
  * slave: B device, ID pin floating
  * device role can be changed later via SRP or HNP
* usb c
  * A plug: downstream facing port (DFP)
  * B plug: upstream facing port (UFP)
  * dual role port (DRP)
    * otg is considered DRP in usb c's term
  * CC: configuration pin, used to determine role
    * pull up resistor -> DFP
    * pull down resistor -> UFP
    * DRP will alternate its resistor setting
  * Vconn: power for active cable
* Power domain
  * Source vs Sink
  * Host will assume the role of source
  * for otg, source is set via specific pull down resistance
  * for usb c, source is negotiated over USB PD
