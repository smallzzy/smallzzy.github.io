## basic

- `PRIMARY KEY`: a unique key to identify each row
  - db usualy use a b+ tree for disk performance
  - a incremental primary key force node update on the right most node?
  - unique, index
  - a primary key can be created over many column
- foreign key: refers to primary key in another table
- `NOT NULL`: does not accept null value
- unique: indicate uniqueness on the column
  - can accept one null value
- check: check value against constraint
- default: provide default value
- index: create index to help with search
- `AUTOINCREMENT`

## data type

- string type:
  - `CHAR`: fixed length (all unused space filled with blank)
  - `VARCHAR`: variable length (unused space left unused)

todo

## query

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT | ALL] {* | select_list}
FROM {table_name | view_name}
WHERE
ORDER BY
```

## join

- `INNER JOIN`: return only records having pair on both sides
- `LEFT JOIN`: return all records from the “left” table, no matter if they have pair in the “right” table or not
- `RIGHT JOIN`: similaer to LEFT, rarely used
- `CROSS JOIN`: return all pairs?

## normal form

- 1NF: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
- 2NF: 1NF + It does not have any `non-prime attribute` that is functionally dependent on any proper subset of any `candidate key` of the relation
  - candidate key consists of `prime attribute`
- 3NF: If all the attributes are functionally dependent on solely the primary key

To normalize a database, we usually

- create a separate table for each set of related data
- identify each set of related data with a primary key
- use foreign key to refer to row in other table

## note

- `SELECT *`: not used because access on unnecessary column
- string are padded with trailing space until the same length before comparison
