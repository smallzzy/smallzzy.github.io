## sql

### basic

* `PRIMARY KEY`: a unique key to identify each row
  * db usualy use a b+ tree for disk performance
  * a incremental primary key force node update on the right most node?
  * unique, index
  * a primary key can be created over many column
* foreign key: refers to primary key in another table
* `NOT NULL`: does not accept null value
* unique: indicate uniqueness on the column
  * can accept one null value
* check: check value against constraint
* default: provide default value
* index: create index to help with search
* `AUTOINCREMENT`

### data type

* string type: 
  * `CHAR`: fixed length (all unused space filled with blank)
  * `VARCHAR`: variable length (unused space left unused)
* 

## query

```sql
SELECT [DISTINCT | ALL] {* | select_list}
FROM {table_name | view_name}
WHERE
ORDER BY
```

## normal form

* 1NF: A relation is in first normal form if and only if the domain of each attribute contains only atomic values, and the value of each attribute contains only a single value from that domain.
* 2NF: 1NF + It does not have any `non-prime attribute` that is functionally dependent on any proper subset of any `candidate key` of the relation
  * candidate key consists of `prime attribute`
* 3NF: If all the attributes are functionally dependent on solely the primary key

To normalize a database, we usually

* create a separate table for each set of related data
* identify each set of related data with a primary key

### language

* `SELECT *`: not used because access on unnecessary column
* string are padded with trailing space until the same length before comparison
