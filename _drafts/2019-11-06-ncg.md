## IEEE 754

| exponent | fraction = 0 | fraction != 0 | meaning                                      |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 00       | zero         | subnormal     | \\( (-1)^{sign} x 2^{-126} 0.fraction \\)    |
| FF       | infinity     | NaN           |
| other    | normal       | normal        | \\( (-1)^{sign} x 2^{exp-127} 1.fraction \\) |

## rounding float to nearest int

The problem is discovered when investigating `std::nearbyint` vs `std::round`.

There are some [blogs](http://blog.frama-c.com/index.php?post/2013/05/02/nearbyintf1) on this issue.
