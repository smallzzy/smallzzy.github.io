## basics

Active Directory (AD) is a service for authentication.

Microsoft AD is the most common, but many others exist. (ex. OpenLDAP)

AD accepts Kerberos and LDAP as communication protocol.

## ldap

Copied from [ubuntu documentation](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-ldap). Highlighted with keywords.

* A directory is a tree of data `entries` that is hierarchical in nature and is called the `Directory Information Tree (DIT)`.
* An entry consists of a set of `attributes`.
* An attribute has a key (a name/description) and one or more values.
* Every attribute must be defined in at least one `objectClass`.
* Attributes and objectClasses are defined in schemas (an objectClass is actually considered as a special kind of attribute).
* Each entry has a unique identifier: its `Distinguished Name (DN or dn)`. This, in turn, consists of a `Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)` followed by the parent entry’s DN.
* The entry’s DN is not an attribute. It is not considered part of the entry itself.
