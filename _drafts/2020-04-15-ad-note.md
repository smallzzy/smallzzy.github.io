## basics

Active Directory (AD) is a service for authentication.

Microsoft AD is the most common, but many others exist. (ex. OpenLDAP)

AD accepts Kerberos and LDAP as communication protocol.

## ldap

* each `entry` is stored hierarchically in `Directory Information Tree(DIT)`
* each `entry` contains a set of `attributes`
* each `entry` has a unique identifier `Distinguished Name(DN)`
  * `dn` consists of `Relative Distinguished Name (RDN)`
  * `dc=example,dc=com`: using example.com as `base DN`

## setup ldap

* apt install slapd ldap-utils
* dkpg-reconfigure slapd
* the default connection is
  * to use unix socket `-H ldapi://`
  * to use EXTERNAL sasl `-Y EXTERNAL`
