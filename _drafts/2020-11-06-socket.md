## sockets

* socket = domain + type + protocol
  * domain: address family (AF_UNIX / AF_INET)
  * type: style of socket (SOCK_DGRAM / SOCK_STREAM)
  * protocol: protocol based on domain and type (default: 0)
    * `/etc/protocols`
* sockaddr = family + addr
  * family: differenciate different addr
  * addr: a union to settings to be interpreted based on family
    * ex: sock_addr -> port + addr for AF_INET
    * INADDR_ANY bind to all interfaces
* socket uses file descriptor api
  * but not all functions are applicable
  * a file can be generated to verify client
  * other fd can be passed through AF_UNIX
    * SCM_RIGHTS in control msg
    * https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html
  * abstract path?
* byte order
  * `hton*`, `ntoh*`

```c
// both
socket()
// server
listen()
accept() // return client socket for comm
// client
connect() // update socket to comm
```

## network socket

* ipv4
  * MTU
  * do not fragment (DF)
* ipv6
  * MTU discovery
  * implicit DF
* ICMP
* tcp
  * MSS
    * generally want MSS to be less than MTU
    * entire packet resend in case of fragmentation
  * MSL
  * SYN, FIN, RST
    * out of band

keep alive

## socat

connect bitstream between two address

* address
  * open: file
  * exec
  * create
  * various network protocol
* options
* option group
* split io: `!!`
