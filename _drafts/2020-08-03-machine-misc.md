## servo vs stepper

* feedback
  * servo: closed loop with encoder, resolver
  * stepper: open loop
* speed torque
  * servo: constant torque
  * stepper: torque drop with speed
* pole count: higher in stepper
* power usage:
  * servo: variable power
  * stepper: constant power

### servo

* encoder:
  * multi turn absolute encoder
* control
  * [cascaded control loop](https://www.machinedesign.com/mechanical-motion-systems/controllers/article/21834265/adaptive-nonlinear-algorithm-optimizes-servo-control)

* roller bearing
