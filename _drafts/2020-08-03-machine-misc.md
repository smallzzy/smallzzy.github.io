## motor

* concentrated
  * one pole formed over one slot
  * coils turn on sequentially -> square wave
* distributed
  * one pole formed over several slot
  * power distributed over several coil -> sinusoidal wave

## servo vs stepper

* feedback
  * servo: closed loop with encoder, resolver
  * stepper: open loop
* speed torque
  * servo: constant torque
  * stepper: torque drop with speed
* pole count: higher in stepper
* power usage:
  * servo: variable power
  * stepper: constant power

### servo

* encoder:
  * multi turn absolute encoder
* control
  * [cascaded control loop](https://www.machinedesign.com/mechanical-motion-systems/controllers/article/21834265/adaptive-nonlinear-algorithm-optimizes-servo-control)

* roller bearing

## multi-rotor

Chinese weights 
weight attached to tail rotor blade grip

## problem

backlash
stiction
Cavitation
hydralic anti-backlash split nut
recirculating ball screws
Rack_and_pinion

## screw

* acme screw
* ball screw
  * pre-loading
  * double nut: use two nut with opposite loading direction
  * lead shift: manufacture the loading into the nut
  * ball select: oversize ball
* support with thrust bearing
  * threads on the screw

## metal blackening

*  anodizing
*  bluing
*  hot chemical bath
*  copper deposit

## electric power

* electrical standard
  * nfpa 70
* ground wire should only carry current in the case of a fault condition
* gfci: detect difference between neutral and hot

* power supply
  * power line filter
  * transformer
  * bridge rectifier
  * power factor correction
  * switch 
  * regulator
